# **Bank-Churn-Rate-Analysis-Prediction**
## **Objective**
A bank company currently facing some issues regarding churning customers. To face such issue, a machine learning model is created in order to determine the variables that are responsible in making customers churn. To build said machine learning model, there are numerous general information of customers, compiled into a dataset which will be the base of this machine learning model creation and analysis. The final objective is to create a model that is highly capable in predicting whether a customer will churn from the bank or not
